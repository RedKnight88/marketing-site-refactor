# Marketing Site Refactor

## Description

In order to practice my front-end development technical skills, I worked on a scenario where a marketing agency would need their webpage reorganized and cleaned up. This code was originally missing semantic elements of HTML and had a ton of redundancy due to not following DRY coding practices, so my goal was to refactor the code while maintaining the page's style. The marketing agency also had many downfalls within their code for accessibility and SEO, so this also would serve to help their site traffic. I learned a lot about how best to compress redundant code and organize containers in HTML so that it makes sense to another programmer who might need to work with it.

## Usage

This landing page contains at the top a standard navigation bar and a picture that captures the company's hard-working atmosphere. Users can easily peruse the brief but descriptive information about the company's work. The main functionality comes in creating identifiers within content blocks that are linked in the navigation bar, so that users will easily be brought to the information they would be looking for.
